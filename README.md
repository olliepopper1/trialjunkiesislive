- `npm run dev`: Start the server with nodemon
- `npm test`: Run tests with Jest

## Environment Variables

- `DATABASE_URL`: Your MongoDB connection string
- `MONERO_PAYMENTS_API_KEY`: Your Monero Payments API key
- `JWT_SECRET`: Your JWT secret for authentication

## Project Setup

### Initialize React Project

To initialize a new React project in the `client` directory, run the following command:

```sh
npx create-react-app client
```

## Deployment Guide

### Running the Backend

To run the backend server, use the following command:

```sh
node src/server.js
```

### Starting the React App

### Deploying via GitHub Actions

To deploy the project using GitHub Actions, create a workflow file in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Build project
      run: npm run build

    - name: Deploy to server
      run: |
        scp -r . user@your-server:/path/to/deploy
        ssh user@your-server 'cd /path/to/deploy && npm install && pm2 restart all'
```

### Deploying via Docker

To deploy the project using Docker, follow these steps:

1. Build the Docker image:

    ```sh
    docker build -t my-node-api .
    ```

2. Run the Docker container:

    ```sh
    docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env my-node-api
    ```
